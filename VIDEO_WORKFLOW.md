## 📝 Scene-by-Scene Description

### **Scene 1: The Threat (0:00 - 0:10)**
*   **Visual**: A lone user walking down a dimly lit street at night in Hyderabad (Charminar background subtly visible). The atmosphere is tense.
*   **Action**: The user senses danger, pulls out their phone, and frantically taps the **SafeRoute "SOS" Button**.
*   **Overlay/UI**: Close-up of the mobile screen pulsing Red/Blue with "TRANSMITTING LOCATION".
*   **Audio**: Tense ambient music -> Sharp "Digital Chirp" sound effect.

### **Scene 2: Data Transmission (0:10 - 0:20)**
*   **Visual**: A visualization of data packets (Lat/Lng coordinates) shooting from the phone up to a satellite/cloud server.
*   **Action**: The backend processes the request. We see code scrolling rapidly (Matrix style) showing `POST /api/sos` -> `Status: 200 OK`.
*   **Text On Screen**: "Instant Latency-Free Transmission".

### **Scene 3: The Police Command Center (0:20 - 0:40) [HERO SHOT]**
*   **Visual**: A high-tech, dark-mode Control Room with large screens.
*   **Focus**: The **Police Portal Dashboard** (the one we built).
*   **Action**:
    1.  The map is calm. Suddenly, a **LOUD ALARM** blares.
    2.  A **Pulsing Red SOS Marker** erupts on the map near Charminar.
    3.  A **Red Risk Zone** circle is clearly visible nearby, showing "High Crime Area".
    4.  A Sidebar notification pops up: "🚨 NEW SOS RECEIVED: +91-9876543210".
*   **Audio**: "Urgent Alarm Beep" (The sound we added).
*   **Voiceover**: "The command center is instantly notified. No delays. Identity and location confirmed."

### **Scene 4: The Response (0:40 - 0:50)**
*   **Visual**: An officer's hand (First Person View) clicks the **"DISPATCH REQ"** button on the dashboard.
*   **Action**: The Marker changes color from Red (Pending) to **Blue (En Route)**. A patrol car icon ("Alpha-1") on the map reroutes toward the SOS location.
*   **Text On Screen**: "Dispatch Initiated in < 3 Seconds".

### **Scene 5: Resolution (0:50 - 1:00)**
*   **Visual**: Split screen. Left side: Patrol car arriving. Right side: User looking relieved.
*   **Action**: The dashboard operator clicks **"RESOLVE"**. The system logs the clearance rate.
*   **Final Shot**: The SafeRoute Logo fades in with the tagline: *"Safety at the Speed of Data."*
